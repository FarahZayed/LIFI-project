# LIFI-project
Li-Fi or Light fidelity is a wireless Communication Technology that uses the light to transmit data and information among different devices. Li-Fi can send the data at a very high speed, theoretically up to 100 Gbit/sec, over the normal visible light, Infrared, or Ultraviolet spectrum.
Two platforms are use in this project one is a sender and other platform is the receiver, 3 Sensors (MAGNETIC, ULTRASONIC AND FUME) are used to detect events on the sender platform then using light their data is transferred to the receiver platform which takes this data and displays it on an LCD screen or on a phone using Bluetooth module.
